 me of the basics of printmaking! Perfect for readers and makers alike! No 
 prior experience is required.\nA bookplate\, also known as an ex-libris\, 
 is a small printed label which is adhered to a book\, typically inside the
  front cover. It's used to indicate the book's owner\, hence the name "ex-

 tes bear the name of the owner\, sometimes with a motto.\nYou will have th
 e opportunity to make any kind of print you would like\, but we will have 
 some templates if you want to follow along with the "Ex-Libris" print. Eve
 ryone will receive a small Linoleum block for making the stamp.\n\n\nhttps

DESCRIPTION:Come enjoy an evening making your own Bookplate and learning so
 me of the basics of printmaking! Perfect for readers and makers alike! No 
 prior experience is required.\nA bookplate\, also known as an ex-libris\, 
 is a small printed label which is adhered to a book\, typically inside the
  front cover. It's used to indicate the book's owner\, hence the name "ex-
 libris" which translates as "from the library of". Traditionally\, bookpla
 tes bear the name of the owner\, sometimes with a motto.\nYou will have th
 e opportunity to make any kind of print you would like\, but we will have 
 some templates if you want to follow along with the "Ex-Libris" print. Eve
 ryone will receive a small Linoleum block for making the stamp.\n\n\nhttps
