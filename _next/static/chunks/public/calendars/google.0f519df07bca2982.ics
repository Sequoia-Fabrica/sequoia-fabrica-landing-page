 rior experience is required.\nA bookplate\, also known as an ex-libris\, is
  a small printed label which is adhered to a book\, typically inside the fr

 is" which translates as "from the library of". Traditionally\, bookplates b
 ear the name of the owner\, sometimes with a motto.\nYou will have the oppo
 rtunity to make any kind of print you would like\, but we will have some te
 mplates if you want to follow along with the "Ex-Libris" print. Everyone wi
 ll receive a small Linoleum block for making the stamp.\n\n\nhttps://bookwh

 ! Double cotton gauze is soft and lightweight and has an interesting textur
 e that works well for San Francisco's winter\, spring\, or summer. \nThis 6
 0-90 minute workshop is a very quick introduction to sewing basics. We're n
 ot worried about exactitude here-- this is a fast and forgiving project tha
 t is excellent for beginners who want to try sewing and walk away with an a
 ttractive scarf that is not unlike those currently in boutiques. \nThis wor
 kshop will be the most satisfying to beginners! Participants will engage wi
 th the following skills: match edges and pin/clip fabric in place for sewin
 g\, cut fabric\, sew straight lines with a sewing machine\, and use a seam 
 ripper to fix mistakes (you will probably make at least one mistake\, and t
 hat's ok). \nAssorted colors will be available to choose from\, first-come 
 first-served. \nAbout Sequoia Fabrica\nWe're an organization of volunteer m
