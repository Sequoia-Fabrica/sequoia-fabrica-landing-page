 ing busted seams\, replacing buttons and zippers (recommended to bring you

 sage Alaina 718-496-5468 to ask if we can help with your specific project 
 or if any supplies you might need are things we can provide.\nA note about
  alterations: many alterations are too difficult to finish in 2 hrs\, but 
 simple alterations like hems are fine. Message me if you are unsure. \n\n\

 nSew A Stuff Sack\nLearn the basics of sewing and working with technical f
 abrics with a simple yet functional project: a drawstring stuff sack. Choo
 se between a square-bottom or cylindrical-bottom design. You should expect
  to leave the class with a few completed stuff sacks.\nNo prior sewing exp
 erience is required for the first class\, and we‚Äôll be using domestic he
 avy-duty sewing machines. We‚Äôll start with the basics‚Äîthreading the ma
 chine and sewing a straight line‚Äîbefore moving on to finishing seams\, s
 ewing a drawstring closure\, and stitching a curve. If you do have some se
 wing experience already\, don't worry\, there's lots of room to level up!\
 nSkills Covered:\nIntroduction to sewing basics\nStitching around a curve 
 for the round base\nCreating a drawstring channel\nFinishing seams\n\n\nht
