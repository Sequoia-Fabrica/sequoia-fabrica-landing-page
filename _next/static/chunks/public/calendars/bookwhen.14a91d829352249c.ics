DESCRIPTION:Make a fashionable unisex triangle scarf in double cotton gauze
 ! Double cotton gauze is soft and lightweight and has an interesting textu
 re that works well for San Francisco's winter\, spring\, or summer. \nThis
  60-90 minute workshop is a very quick introduction to sewing basics. We'r
 e not worried about exactitude here-- this is a fast and forgiving project
  that is excellent for beginners who want to try sewing and walk away with
  an attractive scarf that is not unlike those currently in boutiques. \nTh
 is workshop will be the most satisfying to beginners! Participants will en
 gage with the following skills: match edges and pin/clip fabric in place f
 or sewing\, cut fabric\, sew straight lines with a sewing machine\, and us
 e a seam ripper to fix mistakes (you will probably make at least one mista
 ke\, and that's ok). \nAssorted colors will be available to choose from\, 
 first-come first-served. \nAbout Sequoia Fabrica\nWe're an organization of
  volunteer makers and artists who like to share our knowledge and skills w

DESCRIPTION:We get it: when you become a parent\, it becomes difficult to f
 ind space and motivation for yourself and to work on your projects. Let's 
 do it together - and bring your children! \nWhile parents set up in one si
 de of the room (with a laser cutter\, 3d printer\, sewing machine\, knitti
 ng machine\, and desks)\, kids under 8 do crafts with an experienced child
 ren instructor or play on the other side. Older kids can work on their own
  projects with their parents\, Children stay in view at all times. Parents
  can go from working on their project to do crafts with their child at any
  point. This week\, kids will be making wings they can wear (fairy wings\,
  dragon wings or unicorn wings!) using cardboard. This activity is appropr
 iate to all ages.\nCost covers all craft materials and activity for kids (
 up to two kids per tickets)\, and use of workshop space for adults. Materi
 als such as plywood for the laser cutter for your project are available at
  the workshop at extra cost. \n\n\nhttps://bookwhen.com/sequoiafabrica/e/e

 prior experience is required.\nA bookplate\, also known as an ex-libris\, 
 is a small printed label which is adhered to a book\, typically inside the

 some templates if you want to follow along with the "Ex-Libris" print. Eve
 ryone will receive a small Linoleum block for making the stamp.\n\n\nhttps
