  preparation steps\nLogistics for hosting at Sequoia Fabrica\nUnlike our t
 ypical workshops\, this event will focus on sharing knowledge and experien
 ces. We will also include a break for networking\, allowing you to connect
  with fellow attendees and explore each other's passions.\nMany of our ins
 tructors choose to run workshops out of a desire to share their enthusiasm
  and expertise with others. This event is a perfect opportunity to meet fe
 llow friends of Sequoia Fabrica and discover new interests together.\nReme
 mber\, Sequoia Fabrica is 100% volunteer-run\, meaning our members dedicat
 e their time and talents to keep the space thriving. We also welcome commu
 nity volunteers who wish to contribute by hosting events or assisting with
  facility upkeep in exchange for access under our hosting policy (https://
 wiki.sequoiafabrica.org/wiki/Volunteer_Hosting_Policy).\nJoin us and take 
 the first step towards becoming an impactful workshop leader at Sequoia Fa
 brica!\nAttached are the slides for the event. They may change before the 
 class.\n\n\nhttps://bookwhen.com/sequoiafabrica/e/ev-ss3f-20241114190000

 . Experience is recommended but not required. \nUnsure about whether this 
 technique is appropriate for your item? Text a picture to Alaina at 718-49
