# Want to teach a class?

**Sequoia Fabrica is looking for volunteers to teach and new class ideas!**

While some instructors teach professionally, many of our teachers are community members who are excited to share their passion or craft with others.

Classes can be one time or ongoing. Experimental or unusual workshop ideas are welcome. If you have not taught a class before we'll give you all the support you need.

## Our focus

* Tangible, physical things
* Arts, crafts, technology 
* Creative reuse, re-imagination
* Peer-based learning
* Affordable tickets

See a sample of our [past events](https://wiki.sequoiafabrica.org/wiki/Events_at_Sequoia_Fabrica).

## A typical class is:

* Weekday evenings
* 90 minutes
* Single session
* Between 4 and 20 students
* $5-40 ticket

These aren't rigid rules. We've hosted classes on weekends and during the day, four hour zine jams, and a six part master class!

Sometimes showing works better than telling. If you want to see how our classes work, [sign up for one on BookWhen](https://bookwhen.com/sequoiafabrica).

## Whatâ€™s at our facility

* Tables, chairs, and workspace
* Art supplies
* Textile tools (domestic and industrial sewing and knitting machines, a floor loom)
* Digital fabrication (3d printers, laser cutters, a desktop and larger format CNC)
* Soldering and electronics equipment
* Woodworking tools
* Printmaking supplies and machines (screen printing, linocut printing, risograph and laser printer)

## What you will get out of it

* Reimbursement for supplies
* The satisfaction of inspiring creativity in others
* Discounts on classes and invitations to members and volunteer events at our workshop
* Professional references or community service verification, if needed
