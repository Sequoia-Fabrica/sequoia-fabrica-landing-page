## When will you have a class on X?

Instructors are volunteers, so classes vary by month and are added weekly! 

If a class is sold out, join the waiting list. This helps us gauge demand, we'll reach out if we add a new session.

## Why did you start another space?

We saw an unmet need for a community serving makerspace and 2024 offered an opportunity to find affordable rental space in San Francisco.

Sequoia Fabrica provides:

* Workshops and trainings open to the general public
* Community partnerships with education and cultural institutions
* High quality tools and infrastructure for artists, makers, and creators

Our organization includes:

* A clean and safe environment where members and visitors can focus on projects, teaching and learning
* Intergenerational content for youth, adults, and elders
* Straight-forward governance and financial stability

## Why did you choose the name Sequoia Fabrica?

Sequoia refers to the iconic California redwood tree. These trees grow from a tiny seed and are among the largest and oldest living organisms on Earth. We hope from our modest beginnings to create a community that lasts and thrives. 

Fabrica comes from the Latin word meaning workshop or factory. It also evokes fabric, fibers woven together to form a whole. Our workshop is a place where people come together across disciplines to build, learn, create, and make things with hands and machines. 

Conveniently, our initials are S.F.

## What is a Grove?

A [Grove](https://wiki.sequoiafabrica.org/wiki/Grove) is the term we use to describe smaller interest groups of maintainers and organizers within Sequoia Fabrica. Individuals will join a Grove that relates to their interests and the tools they use, such as electronics, sewing, or woodcraft. If it does not yet exist, they can lobby the community to start a new Grove.
