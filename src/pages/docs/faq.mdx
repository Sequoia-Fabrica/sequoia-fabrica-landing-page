You must be 18 years of age or older to become a member. Members may bring a family member or friend as their guest. 

## How much does membership cost?

Monthly dues are similar to other Bay Area workshops, $100-150 a month.

We would like to offer more flexible dues in the future, provided we can find a funding source and meet all expenses.

Loans are not tax-deductible, and we cannot promise the equipment will remain in the state it was when you loaned it.

## Why did you start another space?

San Francisco needs more workshops and 2023-24 is a window of opportunity for non-profits and arts organizations to find affordable space in the city. 

Our organization offers:

* High quality tools and infrastructure for local artists, makers, and creators
* A clean and safe environment where members and visitors can focus on projects
* Robust public program of workshops, trainings, and community partnerships
* Culture that encourages teaching and learning
* Straight-forward governance and financial stability

## Why did you choose the name Sequoia Fabrica?

Sequoia refers to the iconic California redwood tree. These trees grow from a tiny seed and are among the largest and oldest living organisms on Earth. We hope from our modest beginnings to create a community that lasts and thrives.  

Fabrica comes from the Latin word meaning workshop or factory. It also evokes fabric, fibers woven together to form a whole. Our workshop is a place where people come together across disciplines to build, learn, create, and make things with hands and machines. 

Conveniently, our initials are S.F.

## What is a Grove?

A [Grove](https://wiki.sequoiafabrica.org/wiki/Grove) is the term we use to describe smaller interest groups of maintainers and organizers within Sequoia Fabrica. Individuals will join a Grove that relates to their interests and the tools they use, such as electronics, sewing, or woodcraft. If it does not yet exist, they can lobby the community to start a new Grove.
