## Why are you starting another space?

We think San Francisco needs more workshops! 

Our founding members have taught at other maker spaces and community organizations for over a decade and learned a lot about what works from these experiences. 

We want to create a clean, safe environment where members and visitors can focus on learning, sharing, and making things. 

Read more about [our](https://wiki.sequoiafabrica.org/wiki/Workshop_Norms) [values](./code_of_conduct).

## How will membership work?

Members should visit our space, complete an application, sign up to pay monthly dues, and be approved by our board and membership. Then they will have an orientation, after which they will receive an access token, and, when trained, can use our shared equipment.

Members get access to our Slack and can participate in Sequoia Fabrica meetings.

We ask that Members join a Grove and contribute to the upkeep of our shared space! Hosting classes is encouraged, you don’t need to be a subject matter expert!

Please review our [membership page](./membership) for more information!

## How much does membership cost?

Our monthly dues are similar to other Bay Area workshops, $100-150 a month.

We would like to offer more flexible dues in the future, provided we can find a funding source and meet our expenses. 

## Can I bring my kids?

Children are welcome under supervision of a parent or guardian. 

We offer some events and classes specifically for families. 

Read more about our policies and resources for children [on our wiki](https://wiki.sequoiafabrica.org/wiki/Saplings).

## Can I bring my pet?

At this time the workshop is not setup for pets, but we hope to offer some pet focused crafts and workshops in the future!

## Do you accept in kind donations?

By prior arrangement. Please email us at [sequoiafabrica@gmail.com](mailto:sequoiafabrica@gmail.com) with what you'd like to donate. We maintain a [list](https://wiki.sequoiafabrica.org/wiki/Equipment_Needs) of equipment we're looking for!

If you have something you'd like to loan long-term to Sequoia Fabrica, we've [got a form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkrRbrPWCJe-pVXQRyJ7k1nDh0zrLgVVYZIwJPtpxaV6SVlg/viewform?usp=sf_link) for that!
Loans are not tax-deductible, and we cannot promise the equipment will remain in the state it was when you loaned it.

## Can I take a class at Sequoia Fabrica if I can't afford the workshop fees?

If this applies to you, please [get in touch](./contact). 

## What is a Grove?

A [Grove](https://wiki.sequoiafabrica.org/wiki/Grove) is the term we use to describe smaller interest groups of maintainers and organizers within Sequoia Fabrica. Individuals will join a Grove that relates to their interests and the tools they use, such as electronics, robotics, sewing, or woodcraft. If it does not yet exist, they can lobby the community to start a new Grove. 

## Why did you choose the name Sequoia Fabrica?

Sequoia refers to the iconic California redwood tree. These trees grow from a tiny seed and are among the largest and oldest living organisms on Earth. We hope from our modest beginnings to create a community that lasts and thrives.  

Fabrica comes from the Latin word meaning workshop or factory. It also evokes fabric, fibers woven together to form a whole. Our workshop is a place where people come together across disciplines to build, learn, create, and make things with hands and machines. 

Conveniently, our initials are S.F.
