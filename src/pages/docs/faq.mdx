# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where are you located?

We are still searching for a permanent home for our workshop. We will be in San Francisco, and once a lease is signed, we will make the location public and will be seeking dues-paying members. In the meantime, if you would like to see this become a reality, consider [donating](https://opencollective.com/sequoia-fabrica)!


## **Are you a 501(c)(3)?**

We are a California Public Benefit Corporation and are in the process applying for 501(c)(3) status with the IRS. If our application is approved your contribution [may be tax-deductible](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/contributions-to-organization-with-irs-application-pending). 


## Why are you starting another space?

We think San Francisco needs more workshops! Our members are passionate about building things. That passion extends to building a community that suits [our values](./code_of_conduct).

The founding members taught and worked at other maker spaces and learned a lot about what works and what does not from these experiences. We want to create a clean, safe environment where our members and visitors can focus on learning, sharing, and making things. 


## How will membership work?

Members will complete an application, sign up to pay monthly dues, and be approved by our board and membership. Then they will have an orientation, after which they will receive an access token, and, when trained, can use our shared equipment.

Members vote on proposals at our regular meetings and elect our board and officers. 

We ask that Members join a Grove and contribute to the upkeep of our shared space! Hosting classes is encouraged, you don’t need to be a subject matter expert!

Please review our [membership page](./membership) for more information!


## How much will membership cost?

We’re aiming for standard monthly dues similar to other Bay Area workshops, $100 a month.

We’ll offer a discounted family rate!

We are committed to serving our community and want to ensure no one is turned away from tools and knowledge due to lack of funds.


## How can I access the space?

We will be open to the general public for regular, hosted events and workshops. Anyone is welcome to sign up and attend these! 
 
If you’d like access to the space to use our equipment at other times, you should [become a member](./membership)!


## Do you accept donations from non-members?

We understand that not everyone can afford membership or class fees. If this applies to you, don't hesitate to [get in touch](./contact).

## Do you accept in kind donations?

Yes, by prior arrangement. Please email us at [sequoiafabrica@gmail.com](mailto:sequoiafabrica@gmail.com) with what you’d like to donate.


## Can I be part of Sequoia Fabrica if I can't afford membership or class fees?

We understand that not everyone can afford membership or class fees. If this applies to you, don't hesitate to [get in touch](./contact). 


## What is a Grove?

A Grove is the term we use to describe smaller groups of maintainers and organizers within Sequoia Fabrica. Individuals will join a Grove that relates to their interests and the tools they use, such as electronics, robotics, sewing, or woodcraft. If it does not yet exist, they can lobby the community to start a new Grove.
