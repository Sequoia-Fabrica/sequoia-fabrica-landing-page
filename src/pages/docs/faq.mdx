# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where are you located?

We're located at 1736 18th Street in San Francisco’s Potrero Hill neighborhood. 

We're convienently near several major bus lines  (19, 22, 55), a bike lane (on 17th Street), and there is street parking in the neighborhood.

## How can I access the space?

We are open to the general public for regular, hosted events and workshops. Anyone is welcome to sign up and attend these! 
 
If you’d like access to the space or to use our equipment at other times, you must [become a member](./membership)!

If our model does not meet your needs, there are many [makerspaces in the Bay Area](https://makernexuswiki.com/wiki/Maker_Spaces_In_San_Francisco_area) and [around the world](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_Hacker_Spaces).

## **Are you a 501(c)(3)?**

We are a volunteer run California Public Benefit Corporation and have applied for 501(c)(3) status with the IRS. Our application is pending. Our EIN is 93-4496044. [Read more here](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/contributions-to-organization-with-irs-application-pending). 

## Why are you starting another space?

We think San Francisco needs more workshops! 

Our founding members have taught at other maker spaces and community organizations for over a decade and learned a lot about what works from these experiences. 

We want to create a clean, safe environment where members and visitors can focus on learning, sharing, and making things.

## How will membership work?

Members will complete an application, sign up to pay monthly dues, and be approved by our board and membership. Then they will have an orientation, after which they will receive an access token, and, when trained, can use our shared equipment.

Members elect our board and officers and have a voice in the organization.

We ask that Members join a Grove and contribute to the upkeep of our shared space! Hosting classes is encouraged, you don’t need to be a subject matter expert!

Please review our [membership page](./membership) for more information!

## How much will membership cost?

Our monthly dues are similar to other Bay Area workshops, $100-150 a month.

We would like to offer more flexible dues in the future, provided we can find a funding source and meet our expenses. 

## Can I bring my kids?

Yes! Children are allowed in the workshop with adult supervision. 

We have some events and classes specifically for children and families!

## Do you accept in kind donations?

By prior arrangement. Please email us at [sequoiafabrica@gmail.com](mailto:sequoiafabrica@gmail.com) with what you’d like to donate.

## Can I take a class at Sequoia Fabrica if I can't afford the workshop fees?

If this applies to you, please [get in touch](./contact). 

## What is a Grove?

A Grove is the term we use to describe smaller groups of maintainers and organizers within Sequoia Fabrica. Individuals will join a Grove that relates to their interests and the tools they use, such as electronics, robotics, sewing, or woodcraft. If it does not yet exist, they can lobby the community to start a new Grove. 

## Why did you choose the name Sequoia Fabrica?

Sequoia refers to the iconic California redwood tree. These trees grow from a tiny seed and are among the largest and oldest living organisms on Earth. We hope from our modest beginnings to create a community that lasts and thrives.  

Fabrica comes from the Latin word meaning workshop or factory. It also evokes fabric, fibers woven together to form a whole. Our workshop is a place where people come together across disciplines to build, learn, create, and make things with hands and machines. 

Conveniently, our initials are S.F.
