# About Sequoia Fabrica

Welcome to Sequoia Fabrica, an intergenetational community workshop fostering the makers of today and tomorrow in San Francisco. 

## Why We Do What We Do

To build great things, you need good tools and good community. Sequoia Fabrica offers both! In the tradition of [makerspaces](https://www.makerspaces.com/what-is-a-makerspace/) and [hackerspaces](hackerspaces.org), we offer shared access to expensive, high-quality tools and machinery in an environment where learning, sharing, and building together is the norm. 

We believe in the transformative power of access to tools and technology. Our mission is to democratize the ability to create, innovate, and explore artistic and scientific realms including but not limited to: Electronics, Robotics, Sewing and Woodcrafts. 

## Inclusive and Accessible

Sequoia Fabrica strives to be a force for inclusivity in the world of technology and craftsmanship. Our doors are open 24/7 to our members, and we frequently welcome the broader community to join in [events and workshops](./events). True to our core belief that financial constraints should not be a barrier to innovation, we offer flexible membership options ensuring that nobody is turned away for lack of funds.

## Our Founding Team

Sequoia Fabrica is brought to life by a group of passionate founding members, each an expert in their domain - sewing, electronics, robotics, wood crafts and fine arts. They each maintain an area of the workshop, teach workshops and onboard new community members.

## Join Our Community

As we embark on this exciting journey, we invite you to be a part of Sequoia Fabrica. Whether you're a seasoned maker, a curious beginner, or someone who believes in the power of community and creativity, there's a place for you here. We're always searching for volunteers to help maintain the space, run classes, and be an overall good community member.
