# About Sequoia Fabrica

Welcome to Sequoia Fabrica, an intergenerational community workshop fostering the makers of today and tomorrow in San Francisco. 

## Why We Do What We Do

To build great things, you need good [tools](https://wiki.sequoiafabrica.org/wiki/Main_Page) and good community. Sequoia Fabrica offers both! In the tradition of [makerspaces](https://www.makerspaces.com/what-is-a-makerspace/) and [hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org), we offer shared access to high-quality tools and machinery in an environment where learning, sharing, and building together is the norm. 

We believe in the transformative power of access to tools and technology. Our mission is to democratize the ability to create, innovate, and explore artistic and scientific realms including but not limited to: Fine Arts, Electronics, Sewing and Woodcrafts. 

## Inclusive and Accessible

Sequoia Fabrica strives to be a force for inclusivity in the world of art, technology, and craftsmanship. Our doors are open to our members, and we engage with the broader community through [events and workshops](./events). We are working on securing grants to ensure that nobody is turned away for lack of funds.

## Our Founding Team

Sequoia Fabrica is brought to life by a group of founding members passionate about sewing, electronics, wood crafts, and fine arts. They maintain areas of the workshop, teach workshops, and onboard new community members.

## Join Our Community

As we embark on this exciting journey, we invite you to be a part of Sequoia Fabrica. Whether you're a seasoned maker, a curious beginner, or someone who believes in the power of community and creativity, there's a place for you here. We're always searching for volunteers to help maintain the space, run classes, and be welcoming community members.
