# About Sequoia Fabrica

## Empowering Innovation and Creativity in San Francisco

Welcome to Sequoia Fabrica, a burgeoning community workshop destined to spark innovation, foster creativity, and build a collaborative environment in the heart of San Francisco. As we navigate our journey towards obtaining 501(c)(3) non-profit status, our vision is to establish a hub akin to the [makerspace](https://www.makerspaces.com/what-is-a-makerspace/) and [hackerspace](hackerspaces.org), yet unique in our approach and community impact.

## Why We Do What We Do

In the bustling, tech-savvy city of San Francisco, a paradox exists. Despite being a global epicenter for innovation and technology, many locals find themselves at a crossroads, lacking accessible spaces equipped with the tools and machinery essential for creative and technological experimentation. This is where Sequoia Fabrica steps in.

We recognize the challenge San Franciscans face in accessing expensive, high-quality tools and machinery necessary for bringing their innovative ideas to life. More than just providing equipment, Sequoia Fabrica is committed to fostering a community-driven environment where learning, sharing, and building together is the norm. We believe in breaking down barriers â€“ not just physical or financial, but also those hindering collaborative learning and communal growth.

Our vision extends beyond facilitating access to tools. We aim to cultivate a space where diverse minds and skills converge, sparking a culture of communal education and creative collaboration. In doing so, we not only empower individual makers but also enrich our broader community, making the spirit of innovation and craft accessible to all.

## Our Mission

At Sequoia Fabrica, we believe in the transformative power of access to tools and technology. Our mission is to democratize the ability to create, innovate, and explore artistic and scientific realms including but not limited to: Electronics, Robotics, Sewing and Woodcraft. We are dedicated to building a space where ideas flourish, skills are honed, and a community of makers, learners, and innovators can engage with one another regardless of background or status.

## Inclusive and Accessible

Situated in the vibrant city of San Francisco, Sequoia Fabrica is more than just a space; it's a movement towards inclusivity in the world of technology and craftsmanship. Our doors are open 24/7 to our members, and we frequently welcome the broader community to join in [events and workshops](./events). True to our core belief that financial constraints should not be a barrier to innovation, we offer flexible membership options ensuring that nobody is turned away due to financial inability.

## Our Founding Team

Sequoia Fabrica is brought to life by a group of passionate founding members, each an expert in their domain. From the intricate circuits of electronics to the artful precision of woodcraft, our team is dedicated to imparting their knowledge through classes and workshops. They are not just instructors but mentors, committed to guiding every member on their journey of discovery and creation.
