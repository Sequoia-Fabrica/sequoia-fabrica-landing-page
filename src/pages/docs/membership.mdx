## Getting Started with Membership
We've tried to make the process for membership as straightforward as possible. If you have any questions throughout the process, please [reach out to us](./contact).

1. **Visit Us:** Get a feel for the space and meet our community. Potential members should visit us during one of our [events](./events).

2. **Sign the waiver:** <a href={urlConstants.docusealWaiver}>Sign the waiver</a>. Waivers are required for all members.

3. **Apply:** If you decide that Sequoia Fabrica is the right fit for you, complete our [membership application form](https://forms.gle/r3AytzzxeKX7NUaM8).

4. **Sign up for an Orientation:** Once you have submitted an application, you should sign up for orientation. <a href={urlConstants.bookWhen} data-goatcounter-click={urlConstants.bookWhen}>Member applicant orientations</a> are 1st and 3rd Tuesdays at 7PM every month. If this time will not work, [get in touch](./contact). Attend the orientation session to learn more about the community and how to get started. We will provide a tour of the facility and notes on our operating policies as well as expectations for conduct, behavior, and contributions.

5. **Final Review and Dues:** Once you have completed all the steps above, you will receive an email confirming your pending membership status. Please review all information in this email as we will need to schedule a final review to get you access to the facility. Before receiving your access, you will be asked to begin paying your dues.

6. **Become a Part of the Community:** Once you're a member, you have access to the space to use as you please as long as it doesn't go against our community rules. Start using the space, join [a grove](./faq#what_is_a_grove), get involved, and help us maintain our workshop.

## What Membership Means

- **Full Access:** Members have full access to our workshop and all equipment during open hours. Members are allowed to bring guests!
- **A Supportive Community:** We believe every member contributes to the spirit of Sequoia Fabrica, whether by collaborating on projects, volunteering, mentoring others, or helping maintain the space. This is a place to connect, create, and grow together.
- **Learning Opportunities:** Members are encouraged to share skills and knowledge with each other. Through workshops, peer mentoring, Grove projects, and informal collaboration, there are always opportunities to teach and learn from one another.
- **A Voice**: As a member (or volunteer), you have a say in shaping Sequoia Fabrica. You'll be able to participate in organizational meetings and decision-making. Your feedback and ideas are critical as we continue improving our community.

Sequoia Fabrica is *not* a workshop for rent.
Sequoia Fabrica is 100% volunteer-run and members are expected to keep the **safe, clean and orderly**.
We live by the rule that you should leave a space cleaner than you found it.
Our volunteer-based structure is how we are able to provide an affordable space.

You must be **18 years of age or older** to apply form membership.

Members can bring friends or family as their guests for tours or working on projects together.
