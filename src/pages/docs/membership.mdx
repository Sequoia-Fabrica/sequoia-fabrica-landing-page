2. **Apply:** If you decide that Sequoia Fabrica is the right fit for you, complete our [membership application form](https://forms.gle/r3AytzzxeKX7NUaM8).

3. **Sign up for an Orientation:** <a href={urlConstants.bookWhen} data-goatcounter-click={urlConstants.bookWhen}>Member applicant orientations</a> are 1st and 3rd Tuesdays at 7PM every month. If this time will not work, [get in touch](./contact).

4. **Application Review** Our Board and Members review new applications as they are received. We will reach out with next steps and any questions. 

5. **Start Paying Dues**. Membership dues are accepted through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/sequoia-fabrica/contribute/sponsor-68571). If this does not work for you, contact us.

## What Membership Means

- **Full Access:** Members have full access to our workshop and all equipment during open hours. Members are allowed to bring guests!
- **A Supportive Community:** We believe every member contributes to the spirit of Sequoia Fabrica, whether by collaborating on projects, volunteering, mentoring others, or helping maintain the space. This is a place to connect, create, and grow together.
- **Learning Opportunities:** Members are encouraged to share skills and knowledge with each other. Through workshops, peer mentoring, Grove projects, and informal collaboration, there are always opportunities to teach and learn from one another.
- **A Voice**: As a member, you have a say in shaping Sequoia Fabrica. You'll be able to participate in organizational meetings and decision-making. Your feedback and ideas are critical as we continue improving our community.

Sequoia Fabrica is _not_ a rental workshop. Everyone is expected to help maintain the space and help with projects or events. Our volunteer-based structure is how we are able to provide an affordable space.

You must be 18 years of age or older to be a member. Members can bring family members or friends as their guests if working on a project together.

We do not currently have the ability to self-fund lower membership rates than those listed above. We'd love to offer more flexible terms if we can find funding and meet our monthly expenses.
