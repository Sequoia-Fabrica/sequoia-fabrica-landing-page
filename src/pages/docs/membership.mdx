# Membership at Sequoia Fabrica

## Join Our Community

We're thrilled you're interested in joining our community of artists, creators, and makers. 

As a member, you'll have 24/7 access to tools, equipment, and space to bring your projects to life. But more importantly, you'll be part of a passionate community that thrives on sharing knowledge, exchanging ideas, and working together.

## Membership Types
- **Sponsor Membership:** Our sponsor membership is priced at **$200 per month**. Sponsors help provide scholarships for those who can not afford classes or full membership dues.
- **Standard Membership:** Our standard membership is priced at **$150 per month**. Covers the full costs of running a community workshop in San Francisco.
- **Sliding Scale Membership:** Membership is available on a sliding scale basis of **$100-149 per month** and is intended for any who cannot otherwise afford full dues. No pre-qualification. Choose this option if you need it!

We do not currently have the ability to self-fund lower membership rates than those above. We'd love to offer more flexible terms if we can find funding and meet our monthly expenses. 

Sequoia Fabrica is _not_ a rental workshop. Everyone is expected to help maintain the space and help with projects or events. Our volunteer-based structure is how we are able to provide an affordable space.

## What Membership Means

- **Full Access:** Members have full access to our workshop and all equipment during open hours. Members are allowed to bring guests!
- **A Supportive Community:** We believe every member contributes to the spirit of Sequoia Fabrica, whether by collaborating on projects, volunteering, mentoring others, or helping maintain the space. This is a place to connect, create, and grow together.
- **Learning Opportunities:** Members are encouraged to share skills and knowledge with each other. Through workshops, peer mentoring, Grove projects, and informal collaboration, there are always opportunities to teach and learn from one another.
- **A Voice**: As a member, you have a say in shaping Sequoia Fabrica. You'll be able to participate in organizational meetings and decision-making. Your feedback and ideas are critical as we continue improving our community.

  This process is still being ironed out as we develop a stable system for onboarding new members. The exact steps you follow might differ.
