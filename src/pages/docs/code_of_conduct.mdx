# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all events and spaces sponsored by Sequoia Fabrica (SF), including our physical locations, website, mailing lists, social media, and chat. 

Sequoia Fabrica is a space for tolerance and respect. We value robust discussion and encourage participants to engage with complex, challenging topics. We also ask members and visitors to be mindful of their words and actions and how they may affect others, including being open to feedback.

We ask you to be aware that conversations or actions that may be appropriate within the context of a specific friendship or relationship with another member may be inappropriate in the Sequoia Fabrica space or in a group conversation with SF members or visitors you don't know well.

## Harassment

The Sequoia Fabrica (SF) community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form, including:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, etc.
- Intimidation, stalking, following
- Disrupting events
- Threats of violence
- Encouraging self-harm
- Continued communication after requests to stop

- Unwelcome sexual attention, unsolicited sexual images or content
- Doxxing, maliciously revealing private information without consent
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes

### Sequoia Fabrica will not act on complaints regarding:

- Reasonable communication of personal boundaries
- Necessary measures to protect our community from serious, deliberate harm

## Reporting & Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

All members and visitors are empowered to ask anyone violating this code of conduct or making others feel unwelcome to cease and/or leave the space. Further sanctions may be applied at the discretion of the Board.

The Board may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning an offender, suspension of membership, temporary or permanent expulsion from Sequoia Fabrica spaces and events without refund or notice.
