DESCRIPTION:Make a fashionable unisex triangle scarf in double cotton gauze
 ! Double cotton gauze is soft and lightweight and has an interesting textu
 re that works well for San Francisco's winter\, spring\, or summer. \nThis
  60-90 minute workshop is a very quick introduction to sewing basics. We'r
 e not worried about exactitude here-- this is a fast and forgiving project
  that is excellent for beginners who want to try sewing and walk away with
  an attractive scarf that is not unlike those currently in boutiques. \nTh
 is workshop will be the most satisfying to beginners! Participants will en
 gage with the following skills: match edges and pin/clip fabric in place f
 or sewing\, cut fabric\, sew straight lines with a sewing machine\, and us
 e a seam ripper to fix mistakes (you will probably make at least one mista
 ke\, and that's ok). \nAssorted colors will be available to choose from\, 
 first-come first-served. \nAbout Sequoia Fabrica\nWe're an organization of
  volunteer makers and artists who like to share our knowledge and skills w
 ith others. All money goes towards the workshop's operating costs. Invite 
 your friends and family for an enriching experience.\nJoin our Newsletter:
