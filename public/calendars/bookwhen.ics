DESCRIPTION:Are you a knitter and curious about knitting machines? Are you 
 generally curious about how knitting machines function? Are you interested
  in fiber arts or clothes making and want to expand your range of tools? T
 his workshop is for you! \nIn this class you will make a striped pillow co
 ver (12 x 12 inches). Skills you will learn include:\n- casting on\;\n- ba
 sic operation\;\n- changing yarns\;\n- casting off\;\n- finishing and asse

 We will demonstrate a range of knitting machines\, flat and circular\, man
 ual and computerized\, and will teach you the basic operations on a home k
 nitting machine. This knowledge can be applied to more complex machines. Y
 ou can then use our knitting machine during our open project classes\, ope

 our own.\nAbout Sequoia Fabrica\nWe're an organization of volunteer makers
  and artists who like to share our knowledge and skills with others. All m

DESCRIPTION:Come enjoy an evening making your own Bookplate and learning so
 me of the basics of printmaking! Perfect for readers and makers alike! No 
 prior experience is required.\nA bookplate\, also known as an ex-libris\, 
 is a small printed label which is adhered to a book\, typically inside the
  front cover. It's used to indicate the book's owner\, hence the name "ex-
 libris" which translates as "from the library of". Traditionally\, bookpla
 tes bear the name of the owner\, sometimes with a motto.\nYou will have th
 e opportunity to make any kind of print you would like\, but we will have 
 some templates if you want to follow along with the "Ex-Libris" print. Eve
 ryone will receive a small Linoleum block for making the stamp.\n\n\nhttps

DESCRIPTION:Learn to make your own apron for the kitchen or the workshop. W
 e will make a fairly simple apron starting from cutting out the pattern to
  sewing and assembly.\nThis is an ideal class for a first sewing project a
 fter you have already learnt the basics of sewing machine operation (e.g. 
 in our sewing 101 classes). However\, sewing experience isn't strictly nec
 essary and you can come without\, but there won't be any formal training o
 f sewing machine setup.\nTechniques covered:\n-- Cutting and basic fit adj
 ustments\n-- Pinning\n-- Pressing\n-- Straight stitches with a domestic or
  industrial sewing machine\n-- Hemming\n-- Reinforcing raw edges with bias
  tape\n-- Attaching straps\nPockets can be added but there likely won't be
  time. If not\, you can at least get advice on how to add pockets to your 
 apron later!\n\n\nhttps://bookwhen.com/sequoiafabrica/e/ev-sxo3-2024092113
