DESCRIPTION:Join us for the first event in our Hullabaloo workshop series
 —an afternoon of hands-on making\, creative experimentation\, and good c
 ompany at the makerspace.\nThis lamp-making workshop is all about personal
  expression. Participants are invited to bring an existing lamp\, lamp sha
 de\, or found objects—or start fresh using provided materials—to creat
 e a one-of-a-kind light that fits their style and space. Whether you’re 
 into subtle design tweaks or bold\, colorful statements\, this workshop is
  designed to be accessible\, playful\, and exploratory.\nWe’ll support t
 hree creative paths during the workshop:\nCustomize a lamp shade by adding
  textures\, colors\, patterns\, or design elements to transform its look a
 nd mood.\nRefurbish an existing lamp\, experimenting with finishes\, mater
 ials\, and structural changes to give it new life.\nBuild a lamp using LED
  lighting\, creating colorful or animated effects that add personality and
  motion to your design.\nNo prior experience is required. This workshop is
  beginner-friendly\, with guidance available throughout\, and plenty of ro
 om for experimentation. Come for the pastries\, stay for the making\, and 
 leave with a lamp that’s entirely your own.\nYou are encouraged to visit
  thrift shops for ideas and discover items which are already lamps or aspi
 re to become a lamp. You'll know if when you see it. See you on the 25th!\
